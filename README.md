# sales-data-analysis
 In this project, I analyzed sales data using Python. Key steps included cleaning and processing data with Pandas, visualizing product performance using Matplotlib and Seaborn, and identifying top-selling products. The project delivers insights through clear bar charts, saved visualizations, and ready-to-use Python scripts.
